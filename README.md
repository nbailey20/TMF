# Trusty Music Fabricator (TMF)
Generate a Spotify playlist based on your current music interests by texting a Twilio-owned phone number.
Easy AWS-based serverless deployment that is completely pay-as-you-use (besides Spotify account and Twilio number, see their free trial).

## Setup Instructions
1. Create terraform.tfvars file with information needed in variables.tf - AWS account, spotify account, Twilio number, etc
2. Run setup.sh script to build app in AWS and update Twilio phone number webhook URL
3. Text your Trusty Music Fabricator to say hi, and enjoy :) 
4. Terraform destroy to get rid of everything in AWS if you want to 'uninstall', don't forget to release Twilio number!

## Current Version: 0.6.0
Deployment into AWS and automatic integration with Twilio webhook is working. Initial playlist is created with name "Trusty Music Fabricator" with correct number of songs, orders of magnitude faster than previous versions. Starting to introduce playlist customization through text body. 

## Usage Instructions
- In general, texting anything will refresh the TMF playlist
- Refreshing means - adding enough new songs to the playlist to reach the desired number, and replacing any 'neutral' songs that have been listened to a variable number of times (neutral_song_refresh_rate).
- Songs will be generated by randomly combining 1-3 songs in a user's Spotify current top tracks as seeds for a new song generation
- For more customizable playlist, several keywords can be included in the text body: "size #", "reset", and "keyword ~word~"

## Known Bugs / Issues / Needs
- [RESOLVED] Eliminate network resources / CFT and don't put TMF in a VPC! - Decreased cost and drastically improved speed with default Lambda Internet connectivity
- [RESOLVED] Spotify refresh token should be saved in SSM Parameter Store as encrypted string, not in S3 with songbank
- [RESOLVED] Network connectivity sometimes not working when app is invoked due to CloudFormation stack finishing NATGW->IGW resource and route creation immediately beforehand - added network connectivity test to check and wait a few seconds before trying again - VPCless architecture
- [RESOLVED] TMF doesn't immediately respond with warmup message - Hypothesis: API resource creation in TF is sometimes out of order enough to block Lambda response to text, APIGW returns 500 - updated to use trigger for APIGW TF instead of depends per AWS docs - haven't encountered error in 50+ deployments
- [RESOLVED] Songbank keeps track of / increments play count for songs even when removed from playlist
- [RESOLVED] TMF can fail when writing new songbank back to S3, put object call is timing out - network connectivity check at start and max retries/timeouts added for boto3, verified retries via CloudWatch logs
- [RESOLVED] Spotify calls can also timeout refreshing token - shorter timeout added, VPCless architecture
- [RESOLVED] TMF silently fails when texted during network stack deletion - no issue if warmup message works, no warmup message error in 50+ deployments
- TMF ignores existing Spotify playlists with same name upon app setup, will create new playlist instead of choosing existing (should be variable option to overwrite)
- [RESOLVED] Update setup script to invoke Twilio API to update phone number instead of manually copy/pasting with MFA login
- Need ability to specify number of songs via Hello text to TMF - how to go from larger to smaller? A: use reset keyword or manually remove enough songs to reach desired size
- [TESTING] Need ability to specify that all songs are replaced via Hello text - reset keyword
- [TESTING] Need ability to loosely control playlist via Hello text - specific keyword to include in search query
- Need ability to accidentally delete spotify playlist and resume without having to recreate songbank, overwrite keyword
- [RESOLVED] Need ability to temporarily remove cost-saving mode for faster responses for a user-texted amount of time - VPC-less architecture
- Use S3 bucket keys for KMS encryption to reduce cost
